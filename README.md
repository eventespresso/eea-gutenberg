## EE Gutenberg Integration Experimentation Plugin

Please note this is not a production ready add-on for Event Espresso 4.  We're simply using this to experiment with the new [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) editor coming to WordPress in the near future.

The experiments we do within this plugin will help shape the next version of our editors in EE4 and when Gutenberg ships with WordPress we hope to have ready to go blocks for it.  Over time, successful experiments done in this plugin will make their way into EE4 core.
